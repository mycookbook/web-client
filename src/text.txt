<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>
To soften the leaves and further remove the bitter taste, it is advisable to boil alone in ordinary water for 10 to 15 minutes, 
most people like to add a little quantity of edible potash to hasten this process but I highly advise against it. <br />
My reason being that this catalyst (potash) tend to affect the entire soup in a slightly negative way. 
If you still want to add potash, it will completely wash off the bitter taste and soften the leaves 
in less than 3 minutes of boiling (the reason most people like using it). But then you would want to boil again alone 
and wash thoroughly with just water to remove every trace of the potash.

<h3>Step 2:</h3>
<p>
Parboil meat with every necessary ingredient, use 2 seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and half a cup of onions. 
Allow to boil for 10 minutes then add water and cook till the meat is tender.
</p>

<h3>Step 3:</h3>
<p>
Add the (hot-water) washed dry fish, stockfish and cook until it is tender, add more water then add palm oil, 
ground crayfish, pepper, maggi seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. Stir and allow to boil. At this point, it should 
give a good soupy taste (even though it would be watery).

<h3>Step 4:</h3>
<p>
Then add the pounded cocoa yam as you can find in the video below (at this point you can add the ground egusi 
if you choose to make bitter leaf soup with egusi), also add the ogiri now. Cook till the cocoa yam dissolves, 
(this would likely take about ten minutes). You could add a teaspoon of ofor, if the soup is not thick enough.

<h3>Step 5:</h3>
<p>
Then add the bitter leaves, stir, taste, add more salt if necessary then cook for three to two minutes and you are done with the making of Nigerian Bitter Leaf Soup (Ofe Onugbu). Either of these five can go along with it â€“ Eba, Fufu, Semo, Wheat or pounded yam
